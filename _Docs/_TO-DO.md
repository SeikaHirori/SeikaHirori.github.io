# TO-DO
- [ ] Adjust navigation bar to have padding (SwiftUI terminology)
    - Each link should have more space
    - I think it's hard to tell where the link starts and ends since the underline blends all them in right now.

- [ ] Write short blurb for homepage
- [ ] Write "About Me"
- [ ] Move highlight portfolio into Home page
- [ ] Update Portfolio page with latest projects
