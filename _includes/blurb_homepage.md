Welcome! My name is Richard, or Seika! I am an aspiring iOS developer! Before starting my software developer journey, I was pursuing the social science field and performing arts. After exposure to both fields, I realized that my skill sets were not being fully utilized. 

In April 2022, I took the dive and started my developer journey. There were several reasons that pushed me:
- Testing and Problem Solving suited my style. 
- I love tickering with computer hardware.
- I dabbled with software adjacent stuff, like Hackintosh, homebrew, and Linux.
