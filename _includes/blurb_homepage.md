Welcome! My name is Richard, or Seika! 

Previously, I was pursing the fields of social science and performing arts. In April 2022, I took the dive at software development. Now, I am an aspiring iOS developer! My end goal is to be involved with embedded development (leveraging my love of hardware), but I would love to work other technologies as well!
